# Debounced Search Text Field Widget

A Flutter widget that provides a debounced search text field.

## Overview

This widget allows users to input search queries in a TextField and notifies the parent widget with the search query after a 1-second delay(can change) since the last input. It uses `rxdart` for handling streams and debouncing.
